Self care is often a second thought, and we wanted more women to put their mental health first. Many women spend a lot of time on the internet, whether they are working, browsing social media, or reading the news. Without adequate self-care, any of these activities can negatively impact mental health. This is why we decided to create a browser extension to send self-care reminders that could directly target women while they use the internet. 

## What it does
Once a user logs in, the extension will track their browser usage time. Users can set the frequency of self-care reminders. At the specified time interval, a notification will pop-up, reminding them to take a break. The extension viewer will also provide random suggestions of activities the user could do, and a link to any relevant resources.
